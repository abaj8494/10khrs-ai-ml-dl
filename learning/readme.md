# Learning

For mastery, a formal education is also required; either by way of open-courseware, or by paying an institution.

I have done both, and overall benefitted as a result.

# Lessons

As I progress through more Machine Learning, I realise important facts:

1. always split into train, validation and testing. you will need to tune the hyperparameters.
2. always standardise features before CV (cross validation). check the math, alphas affect coefficients.
3. `accuracy_score` is only for _classification_ problems, not for _regression_ problems!
