* Context

This repo is my 10,000 Hours of Machine Learning.

*IMPORTANT: this repository eventually grew in scope and thus [[https://abaj.ai][abaj.ai]] was born.
All of the files in this repository are a submodule of that repo, and all of the code is tangled with org files in the site*

To become an expert at anything, there is a common denominator:

10,000 hours of *deliberate practise* on the subject.

* Structure of the Repository
There are 3 main features:
1. PORTFOLIO
   - Briefly, these are solutions to *classical* problems, MNIST, Boston Housing, XOR, etc.
2. EDUCATION
   - These contain coursework from my university and MOOCs (that which I am allowed to share). Additionally my textbook solutions are included here.
3. PROFICIENCY
   - These are my more complex and non-trivial projects. They are more fun, but also more novel and thus less deterministic; Kanye West chatbot, Peg Solitare Reinforcement Learner, Ultimate Frisbee Computer Vision, etc.

* PORTFOLIO
In no particular order, here are a list of the methods you will find in the notebooks. The emphasis is on understanding their limitations, benefits and constructions.

- Least Squares Regression
- Random Forests
- Boosting, Bagging
- Ensemble Methods
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- Naive Bayes
- K-means regression
- K-nearest Neighbours Clustering
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- SVM
- Kernel Methods
- GAN's
- Stable Diffusion
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Transformers
- word2vec, GLoVE and NLP
- LLM
  
** Projects

To gain proficiency in all of the above methods, I have solved classical problems that lend themselves well to that particular method:

| CartPole              | N%       | Deep Q-Network         |

* Education
For mastery, a formal education is also required; either by way of open-courseware, or by paying an institution.

I have done both, and overall benefitted as a result.
