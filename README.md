# Context

This repo is my 10,000 Hours of Machine Learning.

**IMPORTANT: this repository eventually grew in scope and thus [abaj.ai](https://abaj.ai) was born.
All of the files in this repository are submodules of that repo, with much of the code being tangled (in the Emacs sense) to the site's origal code blocks.

> "Read 2 papers a week" - Andrew Ng

> "Machine Learning is just lego for adults" - Dr. Kieran Samuel Owens

> "S/he who has a why, can bear almost any how." - Friedrich Nietzche

> "If you can do it without Machine Learning, do it without Machine Learning" - Google ML Handbook, Rule 1

To become an expert at anything, there is a common denominator:

# Structure of the Repository

There are 3 main features:

1.  Problems
    -   These are solutions to **classical** problems, MNIST, Boston Housing, XOR, etc.
    -   They let me practice a particular _paradigm_ of problem solving, "Supervised Learning -> SVM", "Unsupervised Learning -> KNN", etc.
2.  Learning
    -   This folder contains the code I have written whilst following along with textbooks, open courseware and YouTube playlists. Some notable features are:
        - Andrej Karpathy's entire [Zero to Hero series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) series.
        - Michael Neilson's book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
3.  Projects
    -   These are my hard-won pearls.
    -   Difficult (to me) problems that were challenging and instructive to solve. Notable mentions:
        - Peg Solitaire. recursive backtracking, rotation invariant algorithm. <a href="https://abaj.ai/projects/csp/peg-solitaire"><img src="https://abaj.ai/abs_hsv.svg" alt="Peg Solitaire" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; width: 16px; height: auto;"></a>
        - Hashiwokakero. reimplemented in Go with a test suite, see the spin-off [repo](https://github.com/abaj8494/hashi)
        - Kits19: Kidney Segmentation using 2 and 3D volumetric data from CT scans. 57th on world [leaderboard](https://kits19.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/965bcad2-cbb9-42a8-8b56-a777c9f165e2/)
