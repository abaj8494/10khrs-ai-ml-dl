# Context

This repo is my 10,000 Hours of Machine Learning.

**IMPORTANT: this repository eventually grew in scope and thus [abaj.ai](https://abaj.ai) was born.
All of the files in this repository are a submodule of that repo, and all of the code is tangled with org files in the site**

*Why do anything else, when the thing that you could do, would do, everything else?*

To become an expert at anything, there is a common denominator:

10,000 hours of <b>deliberate practise</b> on the subject.

# Structure of the Repository

There are 3 main features:

1.  PORTFOLIO
    -   Briefly, these are solutions to **classical** problems, MNIST, Boston Housing, XOR, etc.
2.  EDUCATION
    -   This folder contains coursework from my universities and MOOCs (that which I am allowed to share). Additionally my textbook solutions are included here.
3.  PROFICIENCY
    -   These are my more complex and non-trivial projects. They are more fun, but also more novel and thus less deterministic; Kanye West chatbot, Peg Solitare Reinforcement Learner, Ultimate Frisbee Computer Vision, etc.

-   Boosting, Bagging
-   Ensemble Methods
-   Multilayer Perceptrons
-   Naive Bayes
-   K-means regression
-   K-nearest Neighbours Clustering
-   Logistic Regression
-   Decision Trees
-   SVM
-   Kernel Methods
-   GAN's
-   Stable Diffusion
-   Recurrent Neural Networks
-   Convolutional Neural Networks
-   Transformers
-   word2vec, GLoVE and NLP
-   LLM

## Projects

To gain proficiency in all of the above methods, I have solved classical problems that lend themselves well to that particular method:

# Education

For mastery, a formal education is also required; either by way of open-courseware, or by paying an institution.

I have done both, and overall benefitted as a result.
