It seems like your recursive backtracking function is not finding the correct solution for the Hashiwokakero puzzle. The issue might be with one 
of the following:                                                                                                                                

 1 Base Case: Ensure that check_solved(p) correctly verifies if the puzzle is solved. It should check if all islands have the correct number of  
   bridges and if all bridges are correctly placed without crossing.                                                                             
 2 Building Bridges: The can_build_bridge(p, curr, dir) function must correctly determine if a bridge can be built from the current island in the
   given direction. This includes checking for existing bridges, ensuring bridges don't cross, and that the bridge leads to another island.      
 3 Adding/Removing Bridges: The add_bridge(p, curr, dir) and remove_bridge(p, curr, dir) functions must correctly update the puzzle state,       
   including the number of bridges connected to each island (curr_bridges) and the total number of bridges in the puzzle (bbridges).             
 4 Direction Constants: Make sure that DIRECTIONS is set to the correct number representing all possible directions in which bridges can be      
   built.                                                                                                                                        
 5 Loop Logic: The loop for(int i = 0; i < p->nislands; i++) should iterate over all islands correctly, and the continue statement should        
   correctly skip islands that have already reached their maximum number of bridges.                                                             
 6 Print Statements: Your print statements seem to be using different characters to represent bridges (-, =, |, ", #, a, b, c, E). Ensure that   
   these are consistent and correctly represent the state of the puzzle.                                                                         
 7 Recursive Call: The recursive call if(solve_map(p)) return TRUE; should correctly backtrack if adding a bridge does not lead to a solution.   

To debug this issue, you may want to add more detailed print statements or use a debugger to step through each recursive call and check the state
of the puzzle at each step. This will help you identify where the logic is failing and why the expected bridges are not being placed correctly.
